This is a Sherwood Ranger XP kit plane. Manufactured by the The Light Aircraft Company in the UK. A very cool project that lets students experience building a plane. The XP (CAT A(UK)) is a clipped wing version of the ST. Engine: D-motor LF2600 2690cc, liquid cooled, four cylinder, four stroke, 91.8hp, fuel injected, flathead Folding Wings for storage Level flight: approximately 70mph.

The prime difference between the Sherwood Ranger ST (Microlight) and the Sherwood Ranger XP (Cat A) is one of wing span and wing loading. The ST has a wing span of 7.92 m and the XP 7 m, they both have the same MTOW the XP therefore has increased wing loading and a higher stall speed.

Model for Aerofly FS2 made by Krzysztof Kaniewski.
